# Network Server and Client Configuration Project

## Overview
This project was a key part of my academic curriculum, aimed at familiarizing myself with various network concepts crucial for developers and project managers. The project involved setting up a comprehensive configuration of a server along with a set of clients, all modeled using virtual machines (VMs).

## Objectives
The primary goal was to establish an architecture similar to the one illustrated in [diagram] (./doc/) This involved implementing the following functionalities:

### Server and Client Setup
- **DHCP**: Automated IP assignment for machines in PV1 and PV2.
- **Quotas**: Implementing user quota mechanisms on local users.
- **NFS (Network File System)**: Facilitating a distributed file system for shared access.
- **NIS (Network Information Service)**: Centralizing configuration data, such as user and host information.
- **Routing and NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Ensuring seamless communication and address translation between machines in PV1 and PV2.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Enhancing network security.

### Services Implementation
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Enabling secure remote login capabilities.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Setting up the web server services.

## Final Task
The last aspect of the project was to develop an automatic installation system for new clients using PXE (Preboot Execution Environment). This setup ensured that new clients were fully configured and could access all the aforementioned services immediately upon joining the network.

This project not only reinforced my understanding of network concepts but also honed my skills in practical application and problem-solving in a networked environment.
